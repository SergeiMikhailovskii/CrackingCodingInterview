  <summary> Task 1_5 (One Away) </summary>

  ```
      One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
  remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
  one edit (or zero edits) away.
      EXAMPLE
      pale, ple -> true
      pales, pale -> true
      pale, bale -> true
      pale, bake -> false
  ```

  <summary> Task 1_6 (String Compression) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

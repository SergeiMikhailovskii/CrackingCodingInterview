  <summary> Task 1_5 (One Away) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
      One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
  remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
  one edit (or zero edits) away.
      EXAMPLE
      pale, ple -> true
      pales, pale -> true
      pale, bale -> true
      pale, bake -> false
  ```

  <summary> Task 1_6 (String Compression) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

  <summary> Task 1_7 (Rotate Matrix) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?
  ```

  <summary> Task 1_8 (Zero Matrix) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to 0.
  ```

  <summary> Task 1_9 (String Rotation) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
String Rotation:Assume you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, sl and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of sl using only one
call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").

  <summary> Task 2_1 (Remove dups) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Remove Dup: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
  ```

  <summary> Task 2_2 (Return Kth to Last) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.
  ```

  <summary> Task 2_3 (Delete Middle Node) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
that node.
EXAMPLE
lnput:the node c from the linked lista->b->c->d->e->f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e- >f
  ```

<details>
  <summary> Task 2_4 (Partition) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need
to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the
"right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
EXAMPLE
Input:
Output:
3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition= 5]
3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
  ```

  <summary> Task 2_5 (Sum Lists) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Sum Lists: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single
digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1 's digit is at the head of the list. Write a
function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
EXAMPLE
Input: (7-> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2).That is,617 + 295.
Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9. That is, 912.
FOLLOW UP
Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
EXAMPLE
lnput:(6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).That is,617 + 295.
Output: 9 - > 1 -> 2. That is, 912.
  ```

  <summary> Task 2_6 (Palindrome) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Palindrome: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.
  ```
  
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary> Task 2_7 (Intersection) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Intersection: Given two (singly) linked lists, determine if the two lists intersect. Return the intersecting
node. Note that the intersection is defined based on reference, not value. That is, if the kth
node of the first linked list is the exact same node (by reference) as the jth node of the second
linked list, then they are intersecting.
```

  <summary> Task 2_8 (Loop Detection) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Loop Detection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the
beginning of the loop.
DEFINITION
Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points to an earlier node, so
as to make a loop in the linked list.
EXAMPLE
Input: A -> B -> C - > D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
Output: C

  <summary> Task 3_2 (Stack Min) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Stack Min: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min
which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.
```

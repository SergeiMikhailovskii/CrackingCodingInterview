  <summary> Task 1_5 (One Away) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
      One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
  remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
  one edit (or zero edits) away.
      EXAMPLE
      pale, ple -> true
      pales, pale -> true
      pale, bale -> true
      pale, bake -> false
  ```

  <summary> Task 1_6 (String Compression) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

  <summary> Task 1_7 (Rotate Matrix) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

  <summary> Task 1_8 (Zero Matrix) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to 0.
  ```

  <summary> Task 1_9 (Zero Matrix) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
String Rotation:Assumeyou have a method isSubstringwhich checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, sl and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of sl using only one
call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").

  <summary> Task 2_1 (Remove dups) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Remove Dup: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
  ```

  <summary> Task 2_2 (Return Kth to Last) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list.

  <summary> Task 2_3 (Delete Middle Node) </summary>
  <br>
  
  ```
Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e., any node but
the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only access to
that node.
EXAMPLE
lnput:the node c from the linked lista->b->c->d->e->f
Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e- >f
  ```
